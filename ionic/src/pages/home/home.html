In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it.Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.</p></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="start-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="8"><ion-img studio-id="home_Image_5912" component-name="studio-image" style="width: 240px; height: 240px; background: transparent !important;" src="build/assets/imgs/machine-learning1.png"></ion-img></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="start-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="14.857142857142858"><h3 studio-id="home_Heading_6261" component-name="studio-h3">Types of Machine Learning:</h3></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="start-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="16.857142857142858"><ion-img studio-id="home_Image_2917" component-name="studio-image" style="width: 240px; height: 240px; background: transparent !important;" src="build/assets/imgs/types.jpg"></ion-img></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="start-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="23.714285714285715"><p studio-id="home_Label_3058" component-name="studio-label">Supervised Learning: Supervised learning is one of the most basic types of machine learning. In this type, the machine learning algorithm is trained on labeled data. Even though the data needs to be labeled accurately for this method to work, supervised learning is extremely powerful when used in the right circumstances.In supervised learning, the ML algorithm is given a small training dataset to work with. This training dataset is a smaller part of the bigger dataset and serves to give the algorithm a basic idea of the problem, solution, and data points to be dealt with. The training dataset is also very similar to the final dataset in its characteristics and provides the algorithm with the labeled parameters required for the problem.</p></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="start-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="25.714285714285715"><p studio-id="home_Label_6695" component-name="studio-label">Unsupervised Leaning: Unsupervised machine learning holds the advantage of being able to work with unlabeled data. This means that human labor is not required to make the dataset machine-readable, allowing much larger datasets to be worked on by the program.In supervised learning, the labels allow the algorithm to find the exact nature of the relationship between any two data points. However, unsupervised learning does not have labels to work off of, resulting in the creation of hidden structures. Relationships between data points are perceived by the algorithm in an abstract manner, with no input required from human beings.</p></div></div><div component-name="studio-grid-row" class="row" style="width:100%;"><div component-name="studio-grid-col" class="start-xs col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" component-height="2" component-ystart="27.714285714285715"><p studio-id="home_Label_9997" component-name="studio-label">Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning directly takes inspiration from how human beings learn from data in their lives.
